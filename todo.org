* Features
** DONE Write unit tests
** DONE Check for dimensionless result in multiplication and division
** DONE Implement defunit
** DONE Implement equality
** DONE Implement generic comparison
** DONE Implement unit lookup (as for dimensions)
** DONE Implement SI prefixes
** TODO Permit multiple dimensions with identical powers of base dimensions
Example: frequency (Hz) and decay rate (Bq) are both 1/time
** TODO Implement units with offsets
Application: degrees C and F
Idea: create a separate type storing the differential unit
and the offset. Implement multiplication and division by
converting to an offset-free unit first. Return the
differential unit from subtraction. Permit addition only
with the differential unit.
