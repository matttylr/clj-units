This Clojure library defines data types that represent dimensions
(length, time, mass, ...), units (m, km, ft, ...), and physical
quantities (2 meters, 3 hours, ...). It allows the definition of any
number of unit systems, even though for most applications in physics
the SI unit system (provided with the library) should be sufficient.

This library uses the still experimental deftype construct in the
current development branch of Clojure. For this reason, this library
cannot be considered ready for production code yet.

There isn't much documentation yet. Check out the docstrings and the
scripts under "examples".
