(ns+ units
  "This library defines three types to represent the basic concepts
   of dimensional analysis and unit conversion:

   1) Dimensions (length, time, velocity, ...)
   2) Units  (m, s, ...)
   3) Quantities (3 meters, 10 meters per second, ..)

   A quantity consists of a magnitude and a unit. The magnitude can be of any
   type that implements generic arithmetic (clojure.contrib.generic).
   A unit consists of a factor (a number) and a dimension.
   A unit system defines a set of base dimensions and associated base units.
   Other dimensions are then defined as products of integer powers of the
   base dimensions. Other units are defined as products of integer powers
   of the base dimensions plus a numerical prefactor.

   The generic arithmeric of clojure.contrib.generic.arithmetic is
   implemented for quantities. Units can also be supplied as parameters,
   but the result is always a quantity. Units and quantities can be
   mutiplied with numbers, yielding quantities. Multiplication and
   division are also implemented for dimensions, yielding dimensions.

   The expected use of this library is to define a unit system with its
   base dimensions and units using the defunitsystem macro and then adding
   additional dimensions and units using the defdimension and defunit macros.
   The only functions from this module meant for use in client code are
   in-units-of, and dimension?. Other functions are public because
   they are used in macro expansions, but should not be considered part of
   the stable API of this library."
